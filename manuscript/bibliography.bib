@article{huang_2009,
	Abstract = {Resistance to chemotherapy is a major cause of treatment failure in human cancer. Accumulating evidence has indicated that the acquisition of resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs involves the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Modulating Akt activity in response to chemotherapy has been observed often in chemoresistant cancers. The potential molecular mechanisms by which chemotherapeutic agents activate the PI3K/Akt pathway are emerging. Activation of this pathway evades the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents via regulation of essential cellular functions such as protein synthesis, antiapoptosis, survival and proliferation in cancer. How chemotherapeutic agents induce Akt activation and how activated Akt confers chemoresistance through regulation of signaling networks are discussed in this review. Combining PI3K/Akt inhibitors with standard chemotherapy has been successful in increasing the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents both in vivo and in vitro. Several small molecules have been developed to specifically target PI3K/Akt and other components of this pathway, which in combination with chemotherapy may be a valid approach to overcome therapeutic resistance. We propose several feedback and feedforward regulatory mechanisms of signaling networks for maintenance of the Akt activity for cell survival. These regulatory mechanisms may limit the efficacy of PI3K/Akt-targeted therapy; therefore, disruption of these mechanisms may be an effective strategy for development of novel anti-cancer therapies.},

@article{focal_adhesion,
	Abstract = {Interlocking gene mutations, epigenetic alterations and microenvironmental features perpetuate tumor development, growth, infiltration and spread. Consequently, intrinsic and acquired therapy resistance arises and presents one of the major goals to solve in oncologic research today. Among the myriad of microenvironmental factors impacting on cancer cell resistance, cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) has recently been identified as key determinant. Despite the differentiation between cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAMDR) and cell adhesion-mediated radioresistance (CAMRR), the underlying mechanisms share great overlap in integrin and focal adhesion hub signaling and differ further downstream in the complexity of signaling networks between tumor entities. Intriguingly, cell adhesion to ECM is per se also essential for cancer cells similar to their normal counterparts. However, based on the overexpression of focal adhesion hub signaling receptors and proteins and a distinct addiction to particular integrin receptors, targeting of focal adhesion proteins has been shown to potently sensitize cancer cells to different treatment regimes including radiotherapy, chemotherapy and novel molecular therapeutics. In this review, we will give insight into the role of integrins in carcinogenesis, tumor progression and metastasis. Additionally, literature and data about the function of focal adhesion molecules including integrins, integrin-associated proteins and growth factor receptors in tumor cell resistance to radio- and chemotherapy will be elucidated and discussed.},
